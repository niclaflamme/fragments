Title: Rational Actors Act Rationally

I almost titled this “The Tests Everyone Pretends to Care About,” but the real topic is larger.

This essay started as a rant about coverage mandates and vanity KPIs and turned into something about incentives, and the gap between what people say they want and what their systems actually reward.

## The Tests Nobody Writes

When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Let’s talk about code coverage mandates. My biggest issue is that LLMs have effectively driven the cost of compliance to zero. Today, you can buy the appearance of rigor for the price of a prompt.

So if your team wasn’t writing any tests last year, and now they’re “catching up” by shipping 5,000 lines before lunch, nothing fundamental changed. They’re still writing the same number of tests as before: basically zero.

```text
"Cursor, I need 95% coverage on this PR. Make no mistakes."
```

Don’t blame the engineers though. This is the rational response to the incentive structure. If you ask for artifacts, you get artifacts.

## The Tests Nobody Reviews

If the tests aren’t being written by a human, they certainly won’t be reviewed by a human either.

When everybody knows that the giant wall of text was generated by a GPU cluster in `us-east-1`, how much effort do you actually think goes into reviewing it?

Just like the tests' author had a magic LLM button, the reviewer has one too:

```text
<Copy>
<Cmd+Tab>
<Paste>
"do these tests make sense?"
<Cmd+Tab>
"LGTM"
```

Machines write the fake tests. Machines review the fake tests.

What are we even doing here?

## The Tests That Test Nothing

It gets worse: the tests that are easiest for models to generate are the least informative. They’re shallow and deterministic, but ultimately hard to strongly object to. So the slop gets merged into `master`.

On the front end, nobody really “wrote” a `LoginButton`. They wrapped a wrapper that was itself wrapping `RadixUI`. When Cursor adds a test asserting the click handler doesn’t fire when disabled, it’s not testing anything not already covered by the `Radix` test suite.

On the back end, the model’s favorite move is mocking the database, also known as the purest form of testing nothing. Of course the mocked function returns what you told it to return, that's what mocked functions do. Real queries fails on unique constraints, transactions, timeouts, and concurrency: the exact failure modes your mock is designed to never produce.

But the coverage number went up in both cases, so everyone pretends its a win.

## Stated vs. Revealed Preferences

Although this is embarrassing to admit, I’ve been saying for the past three years that I want to lose weight: that’s my stated preference. My revealed preference is the number on the scale. The undeniable truth is that I want to keep eating how I eat more than I want to fit in a t-shirt size that doesn't start with the letter X.

Companies do the same thing. They say they want “higher expectations” and “higher clock speed.” But until they’re willing to accept the messiness that comes with speed, it’s only a slogan. Discount it entirely.

If you want to know what they truly want, look at what they reward and what they tolerate. Who gets promoted: the people who ship, or the people who apply the brakes?

## Rational Actors Act Rationally

Every single engineer has access to the magic “LLM check these boxes” button, myself included. I can keep the coverage number green forever. I can generate tests I didn’t write and approve tests I didn’t read, and I don't think that anybody will reprimand me for it.

Obviously, I think that's unfortunate or I wouldn’t be sticking my neck out writing this essay.

Two years ago, I’d have kicked and screamed. I’d have threatened to quit over being asked to perform pretend work. I’d have demanded room to bend the rules and offered my job as collateral if the “5x improvements” I promised didn’t materialize.

But I'm too old now. Without a very explicit mandate from his bosses to stir the pot, this family man has to follow the implicit mandate of his environment.

Rational actors act rationally.
