Title: Rational Actors Act Rationally

I almost titled this “The Tests Everyone Pretends to Care About,” but the issue goes way deeper than that.

This began as a rant about coverage mandates and vanity KPIs. It turned into an essay about the gap between stated and revealed preferences.

## The Tests Nobody Writes

Let’s talk about code coverage mandates.

My biggest issue with them is that LLMs have driven the cost of compliance to zero. Today, you can buy the appearance of rigor for the price of a prompt.

If your team wasn’t writing any tests last year, and now they’re catching up by shipping 5,000 lines before lunch, nothing fundamental changed. The engineers are still writing zero tests.

Don’t blame the developers though. This is the rational response to the incentive structure. You asked for artifacts, you got them.

## The Tests Nobody Reviews

If they weren't written by a human, the tests certainly won’t be reviewed by one either. When everybody can tell that the giant wall of text was generated by a GPU cluster in Virginia, how much scrutiny do you actually think it gets?

Spending human attention on synthetic tests is silly anyway, so why not let the models approve them too?

Machines write the fake tests. Machines approve the fake tests.

What are we even doing here?

## The Tests That Test Nothing

It gets worse: the tests that are easiest for a "next-token predictor" to generate are the least informative. They're shallow and deterministic, but inoffensive enough that nobody bothers to push back. The slop gets merged.

On the front end, most components are thin wrappers around libraries like Radix. When Cursor adds a test asserting the button doesn’t fire when disabled, it’s not testing anything that isn't already covered by Radix's own test suite.

On the back end, the model’s favorite move is mocking the database—also known as the purest form of testing nothing. Of course the mocked function returns what you told it to return; that's what mocked functions do. Real queries fail on unique constraints, transactions, timeouts, and concurrency: the exact failure modes your mock is designed to never produce.

But the coverage number went up in both cases, so everyone pretends it's a win.

## Stated vs. Revealed Preferences

I've been saying for three years that I want to lose weight. My revealed preference is the number on the scale. Clearly, I want to keep eating how I eat more than I want to fit in a smaller shirt.

Companies do the same thing. They say they want “higher expectations” and “higher clock speed.” But until they’re willing to accept the messiness that comes with speed, it’s just a slogan.

Discount it entirely.

If you want to know what they actually want, look at what they reward and what they tolerate. Who gets promoted: the people who ship, or the people who apply the brakes?

## Rational Actors Act Rationally

Every engineer has access to the magic “LLM check these boxes” button—myself included. I can keep coverage green forever. I can generate tests I didn’t write and approve tests I didn’t read. I doubt anybody will call me on it. Why would they?

Obviously, I think that's unfortunate or I wouldn't be sticking my neck out with this essay.

Two years ago, I would've kicked and screamed. I would've threatened to quit rather than do fake work. I would've demanded room to bend the rules—and put my job on the line if the radical improvements I promised didn't materialize.

But I'm too old now. Without an explicit mandate from leadership to change how things work company-wide, I must follow the implicit mandates of my environment.

Rational actors act rationally.
