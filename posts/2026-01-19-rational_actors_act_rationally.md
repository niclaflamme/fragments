Title: Rational Actors Act Rationally

I almost titled this “The Tests Everyone Pretends to Care About,” but that was too narrow...

This began as a rant about coverage mandates and vanity KPIs. It turned into an essay about the gap between what companies say they want and what their systems actually reward.

## The Tests Nobody Writes

Let’s talk about code coverage mandates.

My biggest issue with them is that LLMs have driven the cost of compliance to zero. Today, you can buy the appearance of rigor for the price of a prompt.

If your team wasn’t writing any tests last year, and now they’re catching up by shipping 5,000 lines before lunch, nothing fundamental changed. They’re still writing zero tests.

Don’t blame the engineers though. This is the rational response to the incentive structure. If you asked for artifacts, you got artifacts.

## The Tests Nobody Reviews

If the tests we're written by a human, they certainly won’t be reviewed by one either. When everybody can tell that the giant wall of text was generated by a GPU in Virginia, how much effort do you actually think goes into reviewing it?

Spending human attention on reviewing synthetic tests is quite silly after all, so why not let the models do it?

Machines write the fake tests. Machines review the fake tests.

What are we even doing here?

## The Tests That Test Nothing

It gets worse: the tests that are easiest for language models to generate are the least informative. They’re shallow and deterministic, but ultimately hard to strongly object to. So the slop gets merged into `master`.

On the front end, nobody really "wrote" a `LoginButton`. They wrapped a wrapper that was itself wrapping `RadixUI`. So when Cursor adds a test asserting the click handler doesn’t fire when disabled, it’s not testing anything not already covered by the `Radix` test suite.

On the back end, the model’s favorite move is mocking the database, also known as the purest form of testing nothing. Of course the mocked function returns what you told it to return; that's what mocked functions do. Real queries fails on unique constraints, transactions, timeouts, and concurrency: the exact failure modes your mock is designed to never produce.

But the coverage number went up in both cases, so everyone pretends it's a win.

## Stated vs. Revealed Preferences

Although this is embarrassing to admit, I’ve been saying for the past three years that I want to lose weight. That’s my stated preference. My revealed preference is the number on the scale. The truth is I want to keep eating how I eat more than I want to fit in a t-shirt size that doesn’t start with X.

Companies do the same thing. They say they want “higher expectations” and “higher clock speed.” But until they’re willing to accept the messiness that comes with speed, it’s just a slogan.

Discount it entirely.

If you want to know what they actually want, look at what they reward and what they tolerate. Who gets promoted: the people who ship, or the people who apply the brakes?

## Rational Actors Act Rationally

Every engineer has access to the magic “LLM check these boxes” button, myself included. I can keep coverage green forever. I can generate tests I didn’t write and approve tests I didn’t read, and I don’t think anyone will call me on it. Why would they?

Obviously, I think that's unfortunate or I wouldn’t be sticking my neck out with this essay.

Two years ago, I would’ve kicked and screamed. I would’ve threatened to quit rather than do pretend work. I would’ve demanded room to bend the rules—and I would’ve put my job on the table if the “5x improvements” I promised didn’t materialize.

But I'm too old now. Without an explicit mandate from the top to break the pattern company-wide, I must follow the implicit mandate of my environment.

Rational actors act rationally.
