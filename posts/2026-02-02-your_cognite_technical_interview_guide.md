Congratulations on moving forward in our recruitment process! We are excited to learn more about your technical background and what it's like to develop together with you.

For your upcoming interviews, **you do not need to install any specialized software.** As long as you have a web browser, **Google Meet**, and the ability to share your screen, you are ready to go. Please ensure you have enabled the necessary system permissions to share your screen prior to the start of the session.

Our primary goal is to set you up for success. We want to unearth your true potential as an engineer, rather than testing how well you can "game" an artificial interview process.

If you think there is a better way to showcase your greatness—such as being a prolific contributor to major open-source projects—we are all ears, as this can streamline your path by making standard assessments redundant.

Here is the standard technical pipe:

## 1. Live Coding Interview

This is a **60-minute session** focused on the design and development of an application. While we use **Python** and **TypeScript** in our daily work, you are welcome to use any language or framework you prefer.

- **Format:** Virtual via screen sharing.

- **Focus:** We are interested in seeing how you solve real-world problems and what it is like to collaborate with you.

## 2. System Design Interview

This is a **45–60 minute session** where we discuss your previous experience building software systems.

- **Format:** Virtual via screen sharing, or in person at one of our offices.

- **Focus:** We will explore how you solved challenging problems in the past and look at hypothetical scenarios. No specific preparation is needed, but we recommend reflecting on your past projects and being ready to discuss them in detail.

## 3. Hiring Manager Conversation

The final step is a **30-45 minute deep dive** with your future manager. At this stage, we are already confident in your technical skills, so the conversation is much more casual.

- **A Two-Way Street:** This is a perfect opportunity for you to "interview" your potential future manager, ask about team culture, and learn about our vision.

- **Preparation:** We suggest doing a bit of research on the company beforehand. You can find an introduction to our mission and technology on our [website](https://cognite.com) or our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Cognite).

- **Next Steps:** We aim to move quickly; assuming all stages are passed, we often look to extend an offer as early as the end of the day.

Best of luck! We look forward to our conversation.
